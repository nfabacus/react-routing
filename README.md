# React Routing
this is a simple usage example/template to set up a react router with router history.


## Tooling used for this:
- ### Browserify -> allows the browser to use NPM modules
- ### Babel -> complies ES6/JSX into browser-readable Javascript
- ### Babelify -> allows you to use Babel with Browserify
- ### Babel-React-Preset -> tells Babel how to compile JSX, specific to React
- ### Watchify -> watches for changes and instantly starts compiling. Instant compiler

Also, of course react and react-DOM NPM packages.
Please check package.json.
